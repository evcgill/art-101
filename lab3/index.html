			<h1>Lab 3 - File Stucture & File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our goal was to work with a partner and make a local file stucture on the computer to then add index.html files, and then upload to the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had trouble sizing the images and remembering to save inorder to preview the webpage. We figured out how to modify the css to change the size of the images, for saving I just started to remember to save more often. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment went really well. We over came a few stuggles but over all was able to put in a decent ammount of work. </p>
